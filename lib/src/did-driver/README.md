# DID Web Driver
This is mostly a copy paste of the [did:web](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/did-method-web) method driver. It is a simple driver that allows you to resolve a DID to a URL.
However, we slightly altered it to work for http requests and localhosts. All rights go to their respective owners.
